    "tags": ["credit analysis process", "credit cycle"],
    "notes": "Credit availability is highly convex to small macro shocks: marginal tightening in economic conditions causes a disproportionate contraction in lending standards, widening credit spreads, falling secondary prices, and rising defaults, which then feeds back into weaker growth. Excess returns in credit are earned by aligning leverage, risk exposure, and liquidity with the cycle—underwriting aggressively only when spreads overcompensate for default and recovery risk, and retrenching when capital is cheap and underwriting standards deteriorate"

    "tags": ["neurolinguistics", "semantic", "syntatic"],
    "notes": "Human language processing is implemented as an online, predictive computation in which left-hemisphere fronto-temporal circuits incrementally map continuous sensory input onto discrete linguistic representations, with distinct neural populations encoding phonological structure, lexical activation, semantic composition, and syntactic dependency formation on separable time courses. The hard problem—and the book’s core claim—is that meaningful progress only comes from committing to explicit linking hypotheses that tie formal linguistic theory to measurable neural dynamics, rather than treating brain activation as an explanation in itself."

The deepest edge is not being right on average, but avoiding being wrong at the extremes by acting countercyclically with humility and patience."

Mastery is less about trying harder and more about removing internal obstacles—fear, overcontrol, and self-criticism—that prevent what we already know how to do from emerging"
